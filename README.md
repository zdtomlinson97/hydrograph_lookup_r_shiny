# hydrograph_lookup_r_shiny

This is an R shiny application built into a RMD document, written by Zachary Tomlinson at the OWRB. The primary purpose is to allow people to find OWRB and USGS continuous water level recorders in their area by a number of search parameters (county, aquifer, etc.) and then display continuous water level measurements for those sites. Supplemental data (gwlevels.rds) and images are included and should be in the same directory as this file. If you have any questions or comments, contact:

DISCLAIMER: This code is for display and peer-review purposes ONLY and should not be used for obtaining OWRB or USGS water level data for analytic uses
